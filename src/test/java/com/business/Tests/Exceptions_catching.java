/*                     WHAT IS EXCEPTIONS
 * When we run our tests all the time something fails, it happens very often,
 * In programming error happens due to different reasons.
 * Could be bug in the code, wrong input , network issue.
 * Due to this , every programming language provides a way to handle errors/exceptions.
 * Each error/exception is an Object too.
 *                  What is handling of Exceptions ?
 * If you have 10 line codes and you expect to run them properly, but if the code throws
 * an exception then the code will not run till the end will stop there.
 * But we have to handle the exception, handling means we have to include to our code if the code
 * throws any exception, then do something another action.
 * NOTE :
 * The benefit of handling exceptions (using try catch block) is, if your test failing, it will fail only that test
 * and will catch the problem and inform you but at the same time will jump yo next test, will not stop execution of tests.
